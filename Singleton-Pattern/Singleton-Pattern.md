# Singleton Pattern

## Definition

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only **one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

---

## Type of Pattern

**Creational Pattern**

| Pattern Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Creational** | Deals with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. |
| Structural | Deals with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. |
| Behavioral | Deals with communication between objects and how they interact. |

## Problem Statement

You are building an application that needs to interact with a **database**. Multiple parts of your application (services, controllers, repositories) need database access, but you want:
- All components to share a **single database connection**
- Avoid opening multiple connections (which exhausts database resources)
- Ensure consistent connection configuration across the app

## Solution (Basic Implementation in Java)

```java
public class Singleton {
    
    private static Singleton instance;      // 1. Static instance
    
    private Singleton() {}                  // 2. Private constructor
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() { // 3. Public static access method
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

> **That's it!** Three things: private static instance, private constructor, public static getInstance().

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Database Connection Pool** – Only one pool instance manages all database connections.
- **Logger** – A single logger instance writes logs across the entire application.
- **Configuration Manager** – One instance holds application-wide configuration settings.
- **Cache** – A single cache instance shared across the application.
- **Thread Pool** – One pool manages and reuses threads efficiently.

## Advanced: Thread-Safe Implementation

### The Problem with Basic Implementation

The basic implementation is **not thread-safe**. If two threads call `getInstance()` simultaneously when `instance` is `null`, both might create separate instances.

### Solution 1: Synchronized Method

```java
public class Logger {
    private static Logger instance;
    
    private Logger() {}
    
    public static synchronized Logger getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Logger();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
⚠️ **Drawback:** Synchronization overhead on every call.

---

### Solution 2: Double-Checked Locking (Recommended)

```java
public class Logger {
    private static volatile Logger instance;
    
    private Logger() {}
    
    public static Logger getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {                    // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (Logger.class) {
                if (instance == null) {            // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new Logger();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
✅ **Benefit:** Synchronization only happens once during first creation.

---

### Solution 3: Bill Pugh Singleton (Best Practice)

```java
public class Logger {
    
    private Logger() {}
    
    // Inner static class - loaded only when getInstance() is called
    private static class LoggerHolder {
        private static final Logger INSTANCE = new Logger();
    }
    
    public static Logger getInstance() {
        return LoggerHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
✅ **Benefit:** Thread-safe without synchronization overhead. Uses JVM's class loading mechanism.

## Why Not Global Objects?

### Global Object Approach

**Looks like it works:**
```java
// Global object approach
public class DatabaseConnection {
    public String host;
    public int port;

    public DatabaseConnection(String host, int port) {
        this.host = host;
        this.port = port;
    }
}

// Create it once globally
public class AppConfig {
    public static final DatabaseConnection db = new DatabaseConnection("localhost", 5432);
}

// Use it everywhere
public class UserService {
    public void getUsers() {
        String server = AppConfig.db.host; // Works!
    }
}
```

**Why it still fails:**
```java
// ✅ Problem SOLVED by final: Reassignment blocked
// AppConfig.db = new DatabaseConnection("prod-server", 3306); // Compiler error!

// ❌ Problem NOT solved: Anyone can STILL create more instances!
DatabaseConnection db2 = new DatabaseConnection("localhost", 5433); // Still works!
DatabaseConnection db3 = new DatabaseConnection("localhost", 5434); // And again!

// ❌ Problem: No control over creation logic
// What if initialization needs validation or setup?

// ❌ Problem: Initialized at app startup, even if never used
```

**Summary:** Even with `final`, the public constructor allows anyone to create multiple instances. Only Singleton's **private constructor** truly prevents this.

### Why Singleton Wins ✅

| Feature | Global Object | Singleton |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Single Instance** | ❌ Anyone can create more (even with `final`) | ✅ Private constructor enforces it |
| **Lazy Load** | ❌ Eager | ✅ On demand |
| **Testable** | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy to mock |
| **Reassignment** | ✅ Blocked (with `final`) | ✅ Cannot reassign |
| **Controlled Access** | ❌ Public | ✅ Through `getInstance()` |

**Key Takeaway:** `final` stops reassignment but doesn't prevent multiple instances. Only a private constructor does that.
